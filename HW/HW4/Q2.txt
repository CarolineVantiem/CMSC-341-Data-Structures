Using the definition of full binary tree from Question 1, assemble a proof by induction that for all full binary trees, T,

    nodes( T ) ≥ 2 · height( T ) + 1 .
    
where nodes( T ) and height( T ) are the number of nodes in T and the height of T, respectively. Here we define the height of a tree with a single node to be 0.

// Question 2

A1: Induction Hypothesis P(h): for every full binary tree T with height ≤ h, nodes( T ) ≥ 2 · height( T ) + 1 

B1: Base case P(0): A full binary tree with height 0 has exactly 1 node. Since 1 ≥ 2 · 0 + 1, the induction hypothesis holds for P(0).

C1: Suppose that we have a full binary tree T with height h.

D2: Consider the root of T. If we remove the root from T, we have two subtrees TL and TR. Both TL and TR. are also full binary trees.

E8: By construction one of TL or TR must have height h − 1 and the other tree has at least one node. Let T ' be the subtree that has height h − 1

F1: Then, by the induction hypothesis, nodes( T ' ) ≥ 2 h + 1

G2: Finally, since nodes( T ) ≥ nodes( T ' ) + 1,

H3: by applying some algebra, we get nodes( T ) ≥ 2 · height( T ' ) + 1.

I3: Therefore, the induction hypothesis holds for all full binary trees with height h-1 and we have completed the proof by induction.
